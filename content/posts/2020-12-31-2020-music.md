Without saying anything about the type of year 2020 has been, here are a couple of albums that I loved.

### *It Is What It Is* by Thundercat

Before this album, the last Thundercat album I listened to was his debut *[The Golden Age of Apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Age_of_Apocalypse)* back in 2011. I was a junior in college and a huge fan of Flying Lotus, whose album *[Cosmogramma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogramma)* I had on repeat and whose tracks I snuck into every party playlist. Thundercat was featured pretty heavily on that album and when I heard that Flylo had co-produced his debut, I was sold. Being a bass player (although stylistically *very* different from Thundercat) and a fan of (experimental) electronic music, I really dug *The Golden Age of Apocalypse*. Not sure what happened next, but, sadly, I basically slept on his next two albums, *[Apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_(Thundercat_album))* and *[Drunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunk_(Thundercat_album))*. It was especially sad to sleep on *Drunk* since (a) the album art is so awesome and (b) it features cameos from Michael McDonald and Kendrick Lamar.

Skip two albums and about nine years and I watch the "Dragonball Durag" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ormQQG2UhtQ) thinking "this song rules - I can't wait for the album to drop!" ...and then, I slept on it *AGAIN*. Months after its release, I was driving with my fam (literally my family) when I heard "Black Qualls" on Sirius XMU and felt both elation and instant dread: I needed to listen to this album in its entirety ASAP.

What a great listen it was. The motif of "it is what it is" is threaded throughout the album, and is pretty much how I feel about life in this day and age. While all the tracks are great and add to the cohesion of this (almost concept) album, other than the two tracks I already mentioned, the other standout track is "Fair Chance". Ty Dolla $ign's verse is killer (it's short, sweet, and leaves you wanting more). It also wasn't until fifteen or so listens when I looked up the album credits and found out that the baritone rap/spoken word outro was performed by none other than Lil B. Money.

### *Mordechai* by Khruangbin

This is another band I slept on for a while. My good friend Etan told me about them in 2016 and then a year or two passed until I gave their albums *[The Universe Smiles Upon You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Universe_Smiles_upon_You)* and *[Con Todo El Mundo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Todo_El_Mundo)* a listen. That same good friend also once described me as a "depth" person---as in, in the epic battle between depth and breadth, I always side with depth. And so when I finally gave Khruangbin a proper discoverin', I was all-in. I saw them at Music Hall of Williamsburg in April 2018, then at Brooklyn Steel in December 2018, and then again in June 2019 at SummerStage with [Connan Mockasin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connan_Mockasin).

Khruangbin are *super* consistent---they know they're onto something good---but they're also super respectable---they know how to keep it fresh. This album builds on the mostly-instrumental, psychedelic, spacey/spaced-out funk of the last two albums while also featuring more vocals. But these aren't your average, everyday vocals. These vocals are airy, reverby, and soulful, and fit perfectly with the Khruangbin vibe. "Time (You and I)" is a standout track (the bassline is KILLER) and the album version features an extended dance break section which is just \*kisses fingers\*.

If I remember, I'll add more albums shortly.
