![me](/images/me.jpg)

welcome to my site.

i'm a self-taught programmer who made his way to software engineering via the data side of things (analytics/engineering).

i build cloud-native distributed systems, prefer microservices over monoliths, and write clean code.

look at this pretty syntax highlighting:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("sup?")
}
```
