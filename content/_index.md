# this is my site

I'm a self-taught programmer who made his way to software engineering via the data side of things.

I build cloud-native distributed systems, prefer microservices over monoliths, and write clean code.

Check out this pretty syntax highlighting:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("sup?")
}
```
