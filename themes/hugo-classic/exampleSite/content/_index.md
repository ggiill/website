### For text focused goodness

About twenty years ago Jobs and Wozniak, the founders of Apple, came up with the very strange idea of selling information processing machines for use in the home. But around the same time, Bill Gates and Paul Allen came up with an idea even stranger and more fantastical: **selling computer operating systems**.

This was much weirder than the idea of Jobs and Wozniak.
